                  of Witchcraft and Wizardry; he succeeded Albus Dumbledore as

                  snake, Nagini.Although he was a Death Eater at one time, he
                  became a member of the Order of the Phoenix working secretly
                  against the Dark Lord. Snape’s regret over the death of his
                  lost love, Lily Evans, kept him going as a double spy till the
                  end of his life.

                  sirius Black was James Potter’s closest friend, Harry Potter’s
                  godfather, and an Animagus, who was falsely accused of
                  betrayal and murder and imprisoned in Azkaban. Unlike his
                  younger brother Regulus and just about all of his ancestors,
                  Sirius was sorted into Gryffindor and rejected his family’s
                  belief in pure-blood supremacy. By the time he was sixteen, he
                  had completely severed ties with his family and was literally
                  blasted off of the Black family tree.At Hogwarts, Sirius
                  became close friends with fellow Gryffindors James Potter,
                  Peter Pettigrew and Remus J Lupin, a werewolf.They were
                  collectively known as the MARAUDERS.
