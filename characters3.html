                  Dobby was a house-elf, for years indentured to the Malfoy
                  family, until his admiration for Harry Potter goaded him into
                  trying to warn Harry against coming to school in his second
                  year because he knew what Lucius was planning with the diary.
                  Dobby interfered with Harry’s life a number of times that year
                  with less than successful results, but in June he earned his
                  freedom when Harry tricked Lucius Malfoy into giving the elf a
                  sock

                  Bellatrix Lestrange was one of Voldemort’s most devoted Death
                  Eaters, a cruel and vicious woman who was guilty of torturing
                  and murdering wizards and Muggles alike. Bella, as she was
                  sometimes called, was the oldest daughter of Druella Rosier
                  and Cygnus Black of the “Noble and Most Ancient House of
                  Black.” Her sisters are Narcissa Malfoy and Andromeda Tonks. A
                  particularly enthusiastic member of Voldemort’s inner circle
                  of Death Eaters, Bella relishes causing pain, especially when
                  her victims are powerless; her specialty is the Unforgivable
                  Cruciatus Curse.

                  member of Dumbledore’s Army and a Ravenclaw, who is considered
                  a bit weird by her classmates. She comes by this reputation
                  honestly: Luna simply isn’t like the other kids at all. She
                  dresses unusually, she proclaims her strange beliefs openly,
                  and in some ways she seems to be completely out of touch with
                  what’s going on around her. She has a somewhat bizarre sense
                  of appropriate social behavior.

                  Alastor “Mad-Eye” Moody is a retired Auror, considered one of
                  the best Dark Wizard catchers the Ministry has ever had. Moody
                  came on staff for a year at Hogwarts, but spent it at the
                  bottom of a magical trunk, unbeknownst to anyone but the
                  imposter who put him there. Moody is a member of the
                  Order of the Phoenix. Moody’s favorite expression was
                  “Constant vigilance!” Mad-Eye is noted for his paranoia,
                  particularly in regard to food and drink, but also wand
                  safety; this last may be related to his own missing leg
                  , but that is mere speculation. Moody takes command of any
                  operation he’s associated with. He’s brusque and efficient and
                  anticipates the moves of the Death Eaters.
