      Harry Potter is an average bespectacled eleven-year-old boy who has lived
      with the Dursley family ever since his parents died in a car crash. For
      some reason, the family has always mistreated him. On his eleventh
      birthday, a giant man named Rubeus Hagrid hands him a letter telling him
      that he has been accepted as a student at the Hogwarts School of
      Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry learns that his parents were wizards and
      were killed by the evil wizard Voldemort , a truth that was hidden from
      him all these years. He embarks for his new life as a student, gathering
      two good friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger along the way. They soon
      learn that something very valuable is hidden somewhere inside the school
      and Voldemort is very anxious to lay his hands on it.
