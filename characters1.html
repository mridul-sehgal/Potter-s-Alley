                  Harry Potter is the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the hero of
                  the Wizarding world. He grew up with Muggles, and then came to
                  Hogwarts where he faced dangers and terrors beyond his years.
                  He, along with his friends Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and
                  Neville Longbottom, destroyed Voldemort’s Horcruxes. Harry

                  castle and defeated him.

                  Gaunt (a descendent of Salazar Slytherin) and Tom Riddle, a
                  handsome, wealthy Muggle from Little Hangleton whom Merope
                  ensnared with a love potion. When her husband found out she
                  was a witch, he abandoned her while she was pregnant. Tom’s
                  mother died shortly after giving birth to him one December 31,
                  living just long enough to name him Tom Riddle, after his
                  father and Marvolo, after his grandfather. Tom Marvolo Riddle,
                  the half-blood orphan, was to transform himself into Lord
                  Voldemort and take control of the Wizarding world by
                  manipulating the festering relationship between pureblood and
                  Muggle-born wizards.

                  Rubeus Hagrid is a half-giant with shaggy hair and a “wild,

                  Hagrid’s appearance is very intimidating, but his disposition
