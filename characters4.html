                  The Potter family is a wizarding family from Godric’s Hollow
                  in Devon, although the family originated in the small village
                  of Stinchcombe in Gloucestershire.Potter is a not uncommon
                  Muggle surname, and the family did not make the so-called
                  ‘Sacred Twenty-Eight’ for this reason. James ans lily potter
                  were some of the famous members of the family.Their son Harry
                  Potter grew up to defeat Lord Voldemort. Later he married
                  Ginny Weasley and they had three children. James Sirius
                  Potter, Albus Severus Potter and Lily Luna Potter.

                  The Weasleys are considered one of the prominent wizarding
                  families, although their lack of money and their sympathy for
                  non-pure-blood wizards and even Muggles makes people like the
                  Malfoys look down on them. They live in The Burrow, a
                  ramshackle house of four or five stories “a little way
                  outside” the village of Ottery St. Catchpole. Arthur and Molly

                  The Malfoy family is an old, aristocratic pure-blood wizarding
                  family. They are one of the “Sacred Twenty-eight” pre-eminent
                  pure-blood families listed in the Pure-Blood Directory
                  published in the 1930s. Despite their promotion of pure-blood
                  ideologies, the Malfoy family have been known to ingratiate
                  themselves with non-magical society when it suits their
                  interests. The Malfoys are one of the wealthiest wizarding
                  families in Britain, but they have a reputation for being
                  “slippery”. Over the centuries, members of the Malfoy family
                  have been suspected of holding undue influence over the
                  magical government. Current members include Lucius MAlfoy and
                  his wife Narcissa malfoy. They both have a son Draco malfoy.
                  Further draco and his wife Astoria Greengrass have a son
                  Scorpious Malfoy.
